UCLA CS 31 Introduction to Computer Science 1

These are coursework projects that were a part of UCLA's CS 31 course in the Winter 2019 quarter, taught by Howard Stahl. Scores were all A-range except for Project 7 in which I had forgotten to remove my test code and rather than passing and end-user defined variable, I kept passing in a hard-coded value.

This class familiarized students with the C++/C language (especially pointers) and helped lay a solid foundation for how college computer science courses -- specifically here at UCLA --  would generally be run on the project side of things: specs, testing, submission.
